# Week-3-Challenge-Password

## Description
I wanted a way for me to generate secure passwords. I learned more then I thought I would from this project. All the time out of class I would be thinking about the project, logically how would I use JavaScript to complete what I wanted to do? I also learned that when working on a hard assignment like this, that sometimes you need to just walk away and come back to it another time or else you will just confuse yourself and get frustrated.

## Installation
No Installation, all online.

## Usage
To use this password generator, simply use the slider on the left to decide how long you would like your password to be. It can be from 8 characters long to 127 characters long.Next, you decide if you want Lowercase letters, Uppercase letters, Numbers, or Special Characters in your password.
Lastly, you hit the "Generate Password" button and it will generate your password above!
